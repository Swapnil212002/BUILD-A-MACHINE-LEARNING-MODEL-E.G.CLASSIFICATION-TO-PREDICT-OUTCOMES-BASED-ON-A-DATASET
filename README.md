# BUILD-A-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-E.G.CLASSIFICATION-TO-PREDICT-OUTCOMES-BASED-ON-A-DATASET

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : SWAPNIL SOMNATH JAGDALE

INTERN ID : CT04DF1586

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

# DESCRIPTION 

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

order_id and user_id: Unique identifiers (non-predictive).

order_time and delivery_time: Timestamps to calculate delivery duration.

location: City where the order was placed (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai).

items_ordered: A comma-separated list of items like Milk, Eggs, Fruits, etc.

total_amount: The total monetary value of the order.

payment_method: Mode of payment (Cash, Card, UPI, Wallet).

delivery_duration_mins: Difference between order and delivery time.

delivered_on_time: Target label, binary (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline built in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and scikit-learn:

Data Loading: The synthetic CSV is loaded using pandas and previewed.

Feature Engineering: Irrelevant columns like IDs and raw timestamps are dropped. Categorical features are prepared for encoding.

Preprocessing:

# Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler.

Categorical features are one-hot encoded via OneHotEncoder.

Pipelines are created using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline for clean, reusable code.

Feature Selection: SelectKBest with ANOVA F-test is used to retain the top 10 most informative features.

Model Training: A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the transformed dataset.

Evaluation: The model is tested using a hold-out test set (20%) and evaluated using accuracy score and a full classification report.

# Results
The trained model achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset, correctly classifying all 400 test samples. This perfect score is expected due to the clean, noise-free structure of the synthetic data and the clear rule (delivery within 45 minutes = on time). However, in real-world scenarios, this level of accuracy would not be realistic due to external variables like traffic, weather, inventory issues, etc.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to optimize and predict outcomes in real-time logistics systems like Blinkit. By analyzing historical order attributes, the system can forecast whether an order will be delivered on timeâ€”enabling proactive intervention. The project also showcases best practices in feature preprocessing, pipeline design, and model evaluation, making it easily extensible to real-world datasets.

Future enhancements could include time series analysis, live API integration, or modeling using real operational data for production deployment.
